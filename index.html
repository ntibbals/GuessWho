    <h1>My journey</h1>
    <h2 class="abouttitle">About</h2>
    <p class="aboutsection">Born in <strong>Spokane Valley Washington</strong>, I made the decision to relocate to the
      Greater Seattle area in 2012. Since then, I have fallen in love with the Pudget sound. From the dynamic culture
      to the the lush forest areas all the way down to the wonderful concrete jungle, the Pudget Sound area has
      everything you could ask for. Since moving to the area, I have the wonderful opportunity to meet some fantastic
      people and be apart of some incredible organizations. I hope to continue to build upon that as I continue to grow
      and develop both personally and professionaly.</p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p><strong>Bacherlor in Communications</strong> with a minor in Business Administration from <em>Eastern Washington
        University</em></p>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zillow Group</strong> - Business Consultant on Mortgage Team</li>
        <li><strong>Allstate Insurance</strong> - Sr. Account Representative</li>
        <li><strong>Continuant</strong> - Account Executive</li>
        <li><strong>Cerium Networks</strong> - Sales Support Specialist</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p class="goals">To find a company where I can have a <em>positive</em> impact on not simply <em>innovating technologies</em>,
      but creating lasting <em>relationships</em>. I've had the opportunity to be the voice on the front lines of
      Unified Communications companies like Cerium Networks and Continuant in helping organizations build out through
      technological efficiencies. I've also had the incredible opportunity to be represent Zillow while working with
      mortgage advertisers on their site. My goal is to take that combined experience and knowledge base and apply it
      into the back end development of an organization in optimizing their capabilities to have a greater impact on
      their consumer base.</p>

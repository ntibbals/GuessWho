    <h1 id="myjourney">My Journey</h1>
    <!-- <h2 class="abouttitle">About</h2> -->
    <p class="aboutsection">Born in <strong>Spokane Valley Washington</strong>, I made the decision to relocate to the
      Greater Seattle area in 2012. Since then, I have fallen in love with the Puget Sound. From the water and mountain views down to city skyline, the dynamic culture of the Puget Sound area has everything you could ask for. Since moving to the area, I have the wonderful opportunity to meet some fantastic
      people and be part of some incredible organizations. I hope to continue to build upon that as I continue to grow
      and develop both personally and professionally.</p>
    <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
    <p><strong>Bachelor in Communications</strong> with a minor in Business Administration from <em>Eastern Washington
        University</em></p>
    <h2 id ="workexperience">Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li class ="explist"><strong>Zillow Group</strong> - Business Consultant on Mortgage Team</li>
        <li class ="explist"><strong>Allstate Insurance</strong> - Sr. Account Representative</li>
        <li class ="explist"><strong>Continuant</strong> - Account Executive</li>

      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 id="goalstitle">Goals</h2>
    <p class="goals">To find a company where I can have a <em>positive</em> impact on not simply <em>innovating technologies</em>,
      but on the overall team dynamic as well in creating lasting <em>relationships</em>. While working in telecom I've had the opportunity to be the "voice" of creating technologically efficient solutions and look forward to getting more hands on in my new endeavors. I've also gained first hand experience on what it's truly like to #MoveFast and #ThinkBig while working for Zillow and look forward to applying those principles in a different capacity. My goal is to take that combined experience and knowledge base and apply it into the back end development of an organization in optimizing their capabilities to have a greater impact on
      their consumer base and community.</p>

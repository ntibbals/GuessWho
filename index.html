                <h1>My journey</h1>
                <h2 class="abouttitle">About</h2>
                <p class="aboutsection">Born in <strong>Spokane Valley Washington</strong>, I made the decision to relocate to the Greater Seattle area in 2012. Since then, I have fallen in love with the Pudget sound. From the dynamic culture to the the lush forest areas all the way down to the wonderful concrete jungle, the Pudget Sound area has everything you could ask for. Since moving to the area, I have the wonderful opportunity to meet some fantastic people and be apart of some incredible organizations. I hope to continue to build upon that as I continue to grow and develop both personally and professionaly.</p>
